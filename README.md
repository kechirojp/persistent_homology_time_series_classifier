A time series classification and anomaly detection package using Persistent Homology.

[Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà README „ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ / Japanese README is here](README_ja.md)

## Overview

This package provides time series data classification and anomaly detection using **Persistent Homology**. It implements feature extraction through TDA (Topological Data Analysis) with PD scores and simplex tree explanatory variables.

**Particularly excellent performance in anomaly detection**, effectively detecting structural anomalies and pattern changes that are difficult to detect with conventional statistical methods through topological features of data.

### üéØ Project Characteristics

**Lightweight and Practical Design**:
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Operates with 8 packages only (GUDHI + basic libraries)
- **Time Series Specialized**: Implementation specialized for time series anomaly detection
- **Educational Value**: Code structure designed for easy understanding of basic persistent homology concepts

**Positioning with Existing TDA Libraries**:
- Giotto-TDA/scikit-tda: Research-oriented comprehensive libraries (feature-rich and sophisticated)
- **This Project**: Practice-oriented lightweight library (simple and readily deployable)

For advanced TDA methods (Persistent Landscape, Betti Curves, Persistent Entropy, etc.), we recommend utilizing specialized libraries such as [Giotto-TDA](https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/) or [scikit-tda](https://scikit-tda.org/).

## Key Features

- **Delay Embedding**: Generate point clouds from time series data
- **Persistent Homology Computation**: PD score extraction using GUDHI
- **Simplex Tree Features**: Graph-theoretic statistical quantity extraction (11 dimensions)
- **Data Preprocessing**: Signed log transformation, normalization, windowing
- **Anomaly Detection**: Anomaly pattern detection through topological features

## Basic Usage

```python
from src import (
    TDAFeatureExtractor,
    signed_log_transform,
    create_sliding_windows,
    normalize_data
)

# Data preprocessing for monthly department store data
data_transformed = signed_log_transform(data)
data_normalized, _ = normalize_data(data_transformed, method='zscore')
windows, labels = create_sliding_windows(data_normalized, window_size=12)  # 12-month windows

# TDA feature extraction
tda_extractor = TDAFeatureExtractor(
    embedding_dim=3,
    tau=1,
    max_edge_length=2.0,
    persistence_threshold=0.1
)

# Execute feature extraction
tda_features, components = tda_extractor.extract_features(
    windows, 
    return_components=True
)

# Get birth-death distances and Simplex Tree features
persistence_scores = components['pd_scores']  # Persistence duration for each structure
simplex_features = components['simplex_tree_features']
```

## Sample Data

The sample data used in `example_usage.py` simulates **monthly department store business data**:

- **Feature 0**: Main sales (food, clothing, general goods, etc.)
- **Feature 1**: Related product sales (event products, seasonal goods, etc.)
- **Feature 2**: Customer count (monthly total customer visits)
- **Feature 3**: Operating hours (monthly total operating hours)

**Data Characteristics**:
- 12-month seasonal patterns (spring, summer, autumn, winter sales fluctuations)
- Special period variations (New Year, Golden Week, Obon, etc.)
- Mix of normal and anomalous periods (COVID-19, major construction, etc.)

Using such **familiar and understandable data** allows intuitive understanding of persistent homology's "structural changes."

## Application to Anomaly Detection

**Basic Concept**:
- **Normal months**: Same seasonal patterns every year ‚Üí structures persist long ‚Üí high persistence
- **Abnormal months**: Patterns break down ‚Üí structures quickly collapse ‚Üí low persistence

```python
# Detect months with low persistence as anomalies
tda_extractor = TDAFeatureExtractor()
features, components = tda_extractor.extract_features(windows, return_components=True)

# Persistence scores (high = normal, low = anomalous)
persistence_scores = components['pd_scores']

# Classify bottom 10% as anomalies
anomaly_threshold = np.percentile(persistence_scores, 10)
anomalies = persistence_scores < anomaly_threshold

print(f"Anomalous periods: {np.sum(anomalies)} / {len(anomalies)} windows")

# Identify which months are anomalous
for i, is_anomaly in enumerate(anomalies):
    if is_anomaly:
        print(f"Anomaly detected in {i+1}th 12-month window")
```

**Department Store Example**:
- Normal: December shows regular sales increase due to year-end shopping every year
- Anomaly: December 2020 during COVID-19 shows completely different pattern ‚Üí detected by low persistence

## What is Persistent Homology?

**Simply put, it's a technique to measure "the beginning and end of structures"**

### Basic Concept: Birth-Death

Track "when structures begin and when they end" in data:

**üìç Birth**: The moment a new structure appears
- Department store example: "Time when sales start to surge," "Beginning of new customer demographic patterns"

**‚ö∞Ô∏è Death**: The moment that structure disappears
- Department store example: "Time when sales surge ends," "End of customer demographic patterns"

**‚è±Ô∏è Persistence**: Death - Birth
- "How long that structure lasted"
- Long-lasting structures = important patterns
- Quickly disappearing structures = noise

### Viewing Structure in Three Dimensions

**üèùÔ∏è 0-dimensional (Islands/Connected Components)**
- How many "clusters" exist in the data
- Department store example: "Separation of weekday and weekend customers," "Different generational customer groups"

**üîÑ 1-dimensional (Holes/Cycles)**
- "Repetitive patterns" in data
- Department store example: "Month-end sale cycles," "Seasonal variation patterns"

**üåê 2-dimensional (Voids/Complex Structures)**
- Complex three-dimensional structures
- Department store example: "Complex sales patterns involving multiple factors"

### Why Effective for Anomaly Detection?

**Normal times**: Regular patterns ‚Üí structures persist long (long persistence)
**Abnormal times**: Patterns collapse ‚Üí structures quickly disappear (short persistence)

**Concrete Example (Department Store)**:
- Normal: Monthly end-of-month sales increase (12 regular birth-death cycles)
- Anomaly: Pattern disappears during COVID-19 (disrupted birth-death patterns)

## Feature Details

### Birth-Death Distance (Persistence Distance)

Measures the "length of persistence duration" for each structure:

```python
persistence_distance = death_value - birth_value
```

**Long persistence duration** = Stable important structure (normal pattern)
**Short persistence duration** = Unstable noise (sign of anomaly)

### Simplex Tree Features (11 dimensions)

Auxiliary indicators that reveal "structural details" not visible from Birth-Death alone:

**üìä Basic Structural Counts**
1. `num_vertices`: Total number of data points
2. `num_edges`: Number of connections between points  
3. `betti_0`: Number of separated groups

**üîÑ Repetitive Pattern Details**
4. `betti_1`: Number of cyclic structures
5. `clustering_coeff`: Density of local connections

**üåê Complex Structures**
6. `num_triangles`: Number of triangular structures

**üìà Network Statistics**
7. `max_degree`: Most connected point
8. `avg_degree`: Average number of connections
9. `avg_filtration`: Average timing of structure formation
10. `filtration_var`: Variation in structure formation
11. `max_filtration`: Most distant connection

**Department Store Interpretation Examples**:
- High `betti_1` = Regular seasonal patterns exist
- High `clustering_coeff` = Customer groups are densely related
- Abnormally high `max_degree` = Everything concentrated in specific month (sign of anomaly)

### Practical Analysis Steps

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
```python
# Monthly department store data (24 months)
data = np.array([
    [sales1, sales2, customers, hours],  # January
    [sales1, sales2, customers, hours],  # February
    # ... 24 months of data
])
```

**Step 2: Preprocessing**
```python
# Smooth and normalize data
data_transformed = signed_log_transform(data)
data_normalized, _ = normalize_data(data_transformed)
windows, labels = create_sliding_windows(data_normalized, window_size=12)  # 12-month windows
```

**Step 3: Persistent Homology Analysis**
```python
# Birth-death analysis for each window
tda_extractor = TDAFeatureExtractor()
features, components = tda_extractor.extract_features(windows, return_components=True)

# Check "structural stability" for each month
persistence_scores = components['pd_scores']
simplex_features = components['simplex_tree_features']
```

**Step 4: Anomaly Month Detection**
```python
# Abnormally short persistence = Unstable structure = Anomaly month
threshold = np.percentile(persistence_scores, 5)  # Bottom 5%
anomaly_months = persistence_scores < threshold

print(f"Anomalous months: {np.where(anomaly_months)[0] + 1}th month")
```

This method allows **intuitive understanding of "why that month is anomalous" from a structural perspective**.

## Advantages of Topological Anomaly Detection

- **Shape Change Detection**: Captures topological structural changes in data
- **Noise Tolerance**: Filtering through persistence thresholds
- **Multi-dimensional Support**: Effective even for high-dimensional time series data
